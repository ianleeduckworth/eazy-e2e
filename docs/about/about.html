    <h2>About EazyE2E</h2>
    <p>
        EazyE2E was born out of a disatisfaction with the tools that are currently avilable for automating WPF and Winforms applications.  This, along with the 
        growing need for automation made us feel like it was time to introduce a framework that was powerful, easy to use, and well documented.  This is intended 
        to be a framework that gives you everything that you would need to maintain powerful automated tests that will catch bugs before they ever get to a higher 
        environment.  We exist to save you time and money as well as to give you peace of mind.  Get EazyE2E set up and you can feel free to change that line of code 
        that you have been eyeballing for the last 7 months without worrying that it will break some other piece of functionality somewhere else.  We feel that you 
        should spend more time and money writing functionality for your users and less time and money running through a repetitive and sometimes massive suite of 
        regression tests.
    </p>
    <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        EazyE2E does not, and will not ever, collect any data and does not store any information about its users.  The software makes no API calls, sends no packets of data 
        to any location, opens no sockets etc.  We are a small shop dedicated to simply providing a free service to all who have gone through the pain of regression 
        testing a huge, old, lumbering application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only information that EazyE2E receives about its users comes from NuGet statistics which only show the number of downloads and the number of users on each 
        version.  Nothing that EazyE2E receives is personally identifiable.
